Our facilites have pools, non-alcoholic beverges, spa's, and gym's. Our medical staff will work with those students one on one; identifying what caused them to drink, how they began to drink, and laying out the steps to break out of their addiction. We want those families to feel at ease when they send their child to us because they will know that they are in good hands and that they will be cured.</p>

		<p>Our friend here Douglas(the man in the middle) struggled with his Alcohol Addiction. He began drinking around his sophomore year in college. He went to a fraternity party in 2015 and got wasted. Afterwards, he began to drink too much and his life went downwards. He couldn't get a job and he was losing hope; until he decided to call CDHC. At first, Douglas oubted whether we could help him end his addiction to alcohol. After going through the therapies as well as talking to the doctors about treatment, Douglas was able to get rid of his addiction. He is now a high school basketball coach at BerryWood Highschool in New Jersey. Also, he donates and volunteers for our organzation as well as speaks to other students about the dangers of alcohol at our events. He always says that "without the help of CDHC, I would have never been able to send time with my family and friends or even be a coach." </p>
