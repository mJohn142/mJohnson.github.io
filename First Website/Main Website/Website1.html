<p>Alcoholism/Alcohol abuse/Alcohol dependency is the unhealthy habit of consuming too much alcohol daily. It can cause craving (a strong need to drink), loss of control (not being able to stop drinking once you've started), physical dependence (withdrawal symptoms), and tolerance (the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effect).</p>
 <p>It can lead to serious problems such as car crashes and other accidents; Risky behavior,
violent behavior, suicide and homicide. Some of the symptoms are Alcohol abuse(just like Alcoholism except at its infant stage), Alcohol Use Disorder(a medical condition that doctors diagnose when a patient’s drinking causes distress or harm), and Binge drinking(a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men—in about 2 hours).</p>
 <p>According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),  86.4 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.1 percent reported that they drank in the past year; 56.0 percent reported that they drank in the past month.</p>
<p>Families of these students worry about their children who are living on campus due to frat parties and hazing.  Especially those who are athletes.

		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<img class="image2" src="img/collegedrinking1.jpg" alt="">
			<p>Our organization was founded by our leader Matthew Johnson in the  year 2017. He wanted to eradicate Alcoholism in  college drinking because he lost his best friend to alcoholism on March 10th, 2015. His friend went to St. John’s and  graduated in May 2014. That’s when Matthew had  decided to do something about it.</p>
			<p>In 2015, 26.9 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they engaged in binge drinking in the past month; 7.0 percent reported that they engaged in heavy alcohol use in the past month.</p> 
		<p>CDHC works to prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on college students. We also aim to support, inform and inspire vulnerable and disadvantaged students to help them reach their full potential.</p>
		<p>Our organization focuses on three core areas:</p>
<p>1. To inform and educate people about the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on college students.</p>
<p>2. To provide support for those most vulnerable, those at high risk of misuse or disadvantaged through circumstance.</p>
<p>3. To support personal development of disadvantaged students.</p>

		<p>John Holmes once said that “There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.” Our founder had that quote in mind when he decided to make the CDHC; however, without the help from his friends, family, and co-workers, he would have never been able to fulfil this dream. All the support that he had received has allowed him and his organization to help so many college students and families end their alchohol addiction. Without the support, the organization and our founder would have not been able to accomplish the task at hand. So, with your help, we can truely end Alcoholism!   </p>

		<p>Winston Churchill once said that “You make a living by what you get. You make a life by what you give.” At the College Drinking Help Center, our staff prides themselves on giving back to the communities across the world. We love helping others succeed in their quest to end their addiction. Many of our volunteers range from kids who are either 10-17 years of age or even older. We try to engage everyone within the communites that we are located by to either help us build more facilites, plant flowers, set up events on Alcoholism, or have small gaming events. If you are willing to help us, please go to our volunteers page. </p>
