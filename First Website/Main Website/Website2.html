<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>Our organization wants to help college students and their families by ensuring them that there children will be in the safest environment. They will be surrounded by our medical staff 24/7. Our facilites have pools, non-alcoholic beverges, spa's, and gym's. Our medical staff will work with those students one on one; identifying what caused them to drink, how they began to drink, and laying out the steps to break out of their addiction. We want those families to feel at ease when they send their child to us because they will know that they are in good hands and that they will be cured. </p>
